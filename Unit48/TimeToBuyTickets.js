/** 
 * Question 2
There are n people in a line waiting to purchase tickets, with the 0th person at the front and the (n - 1)th person at the back. 

You are given a 0-indexed integer array of tickets of length n, where tickets[I] represents the number of tickets that the ith person wishes to purchase. 

Each person purchases a ticket in exactly one second. A person can only purchase one ticket at a time and must return to the end of the line (which happens instantly) to purchase additional tickets. If a person has no more tickets to buy, he or she will leave the line. 

Return the time spent for the individual atâ€¯position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets. 

Example:

Input: tickets = [2,3,2], k = 2
Output: 6
 */

function timeNeededToBuyTickets(tickets, k) {
  let time_taken = 0;

  while(tickets[k] > 0) {
    for(let i = 0; i < tickets.length; i++) {
      if(tickets[i] > 0) {
        tickets[i] = tickets[i] - 1;
        time_taken++;
      }
      if(i === k && tickets[i] === 0) {
        return time_taken;
      }
    }
  }
  return time_taken;

}

const tickets = [2,3,2];
const k = 2;
console.log(timeNeededToBuyTickets(tickets, k));
